# New Project

This project is a static web-based replica of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. It focuses on replicating the user interface (UI) and core frontend functionalities, demonstrating skills in HTML, CSS. While it doesn't have a backend or live music streaming, it provides a visual and interactive experience to Spotify's interface.
